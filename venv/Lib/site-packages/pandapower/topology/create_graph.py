     Converts a pandapower network into a NetworkX graph, which is a is a simplified representation
     of a network's topology, reduced to nodes and edges. Busses are being represented by nodes
     (Note: only buses with in_service = 1 appear in the graph), edges represent physical
     connections between buses (typically lines or trafos).

     INPUT:
        **net** (pandapowerNet) - variable that contains a pandapower network


     OPTIONAL:
        **respect_switches** (boolean, True) - True: open switches (line, trafo, bus) are being \
            considered (no edge between nodes)
            False: open switches are being ignored

        **include_lines** (boolean, True) - determines, whether lines get converted to edges

        **include_impedances** (boolean, True) - determines, whether per unit impedances
            (net.impedance) are converted to edges

        **include_trafos** (boolean, True) - determines, whether trafos get converted to edges

        **nogobuses** (integer/list, None) - nogobuses are not being considered in the graph

        **notravbuses** (integer/list, None) - lines connected to these buses are not being
            considered in the graph

        **multi** (boolean, True) - True: The function generates a NetworkX MultiGraph, which allows
            multiple parallel edges between nodes
            False: NetworkX Graph (no multiple parallel edges)

     OUTPUT:
        **mg** - Returns the required NetworkX graph

     EXAMPLE:
         import pandapower.topology as top

         mg = top.create_nx_graph(net, respect_switches = False)
         # converts the pandapower network "net" to a MultiGraph. Open switches will be ignored.
